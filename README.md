Welcome to the Automation Tasks repository! 
This project is dedicated to simplifying and automating repetitive tasks using Python scripts. The repository includes two main scripts:

Selenium Script The automation_selenium.py script uses the Selenium library to automate interactions on the Web. It can open a browser, navigate to a specified web page and fill in a form, demonstrating the power of web automation.

PyAutoGUI Script The automation_pyautogui.py script takes advantage of PyAutoGUI to automate mouse and keyboard actions. It can perform tasks such as moving the mouse, clicking and typing, providing a versatile solution for various automation needs.

Feel free to explore each script's respective directory for detailed instructions on configuration and use. Contributions are welcome and we encourage you to improve the scripts or introduce new features. See the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute.

Thank you for visiting the Automation Tasks repository. Simplify your tasks and increase productivity with these automation scripts!
